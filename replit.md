## Overview

WorkLogix is a multi-tenant task management system designed with a three-tier hierarchy: Super Admins, Company Admins, and Company Members. It enables Super Admins to manage multiple companies, each with its own admins and members. The system features role-based access control, company-scoped data isolation, member slot limits, and time-based reporting. The project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for task management within a structured organizational hierarchy.

## User Preferences

I prefer a clear, modern UI with a clean aesthetic, drawing inspiration from tools like Linear and Notion. The design should prioritize responsiveness and include dark mode support. For development, I favor an iterative approach, focusing on core functionalities first and then expanding. I appreciate detailed explanations, especially for complex architectural decisions. Please ensure that all changes are well-documented and follow best practices for security and maintainability.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions

-   **Design Philosophy**: Clean, modern interface inspired by Linear and Notion.
-   **Color Scheme**: Professional with a deep blue primary color.
-   **Typography**: "Inter" font for UI, "JetBrains Mono" for data/timestamps.
-   **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach with full responsiveness.
-   **Theming**: Dark mode support implemented throughout.
-   **Components**: Utilizes Shadcn UI for consistent and accessible components.
-   **Navigation**: Multi-page navigation system with a persistent left sidebar for user and admin dashboards.

### Technical Implementations

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend**: Express.js.
-   **State Management**: React Query and Context API.
-   **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In, supporting Super Admin, Company Admin, and Company Member roles.
-   **Authorization**: Role-based access control and company-scoped authorization applied to all data (tasks, reports, messages, ratings).
-   **Multi-Tenancy**: Three-tier hierarchy, `companyId` foreign keys for data isolation, and slot-based member limits (`maxAdmins`, `maxMembers`) for companies.
-   **User Management**: Admins can create company-specific users with controlled credentials and role assignments. Super Admins are created via public signup with specific email criteria.
-   **Task Management**: Tasks with priority, deadline, status, and a real-time timer system for daily time tracking.
-   **Reporting**: Time-based (morning/evening) report submissions and viewing, with comprehensive details.
-   **Communication**: Private messaging between admins and users, and group announcements from admins.
-   **Security (Current Limitation)**: Development relies on client-supplied `x-user-id` headers for authentication. **This is a critical security limitation and is not production-ready; proper server-side token verification (e.g., Firebase Admin SDK) or session management is required before deployment.**

### Feature Specifications

-   **Company Management**: Super Admins can manage companies, including creation, editing settings (name, slot limits), and removal.
-   **User Dashboards**: Features time-based forms, task tracking, private messages, group announcements, performance ratings display, and file uploads.
-   **Admin Dashboards**: Provide company information, user management (with slot enforcement), task creation/assignment, report management, communication center, and rating/feedback systems.
-   **Data Archiving**: Management of archived historical reports.
-   **Email Notifications**: Automated email notifications for report submissions.

### System Design Choices

-   **Database Schema**: PostgreSQL database with tables like `companies`, `users`, `tasks`, `task_time_logs`, `reports`, `messages`, `group_messages`, `ratings`, `file_uploads`, and `archive_reports`. All multi-tenant tables include a `companyId` foreign key.
-   **API Endpoints**: RESTful API endpoints for authentication, company management, user management, tasks, reports, messages, ratings, files, and dashboard statistics, all with company-based authorization.

## External Dependencies

-   **Authentication**: Firebase (Google Sign-In)
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL
-   **Email Service**: Resend

## Recent Updates

### October 17, 2025 - Critical Company Scoping Bug Fix

  - Added `emailSent` boolean field to track notification delivery status
  - Added `invoiceUrl` field for future PDF invoice storage
  - Receipt number format: `WL-RCPT-YYYYMMDD-{paymentId}` for guaranteed uniqueness
- ✅ **Transactional Payment Processing**:
  - Created `completePaymentWithSlots()` method using database transaction
  - Atomic operations: Payment status update → Slot allocation (both succeed or both rollback)
  - Idempotent verification: WHERE clause with `paymentStatus='pending'` prevents duplicate processing
  - Concurrent request handling: Returns null if already processed, triggers retry path
  - Order critical: Payment status checked FIRST before slot increments (prevents over-allocation)
- ✅ **Email Notification System** (`server/email.ts`):
  - Professional HTML email templates with company branding
  - Payment confirmation with detailed transaction information
  - Receipt number prominently displayed
  - Breakdown of slot type, quantity, amount, and transaction ID
  - Sent via Resend API with proper error handling
  - Non-fatal: Email failures logged but don't block payment success
  - Status tracked in database via `emailSent` field
- ✅ **Payment History Dashboard** (`client/src/pages/admin/PaymentHistory.tsx`):
  - Complete transaction history table for company admins
  - Columns: Date, Receipt Number, Slot Type, Quantity, Amount, Status, Email Status

  - Sortable columns (date, amount) with visual indicators
  - CSV export functionality for accounting
  - Email status badge (Sent/Not Sent) for tracking notification delivery
  - Receipt number display with copy-to-clipboard functionality
- ✅ **Receipt Number System**:

  - Example: `WL-RCPT-20251031-000042`
  - Generated using payment ID for guaranteed uniqueness (no collisions possible)
  - Database unique constraint on `receiptNumber` column prevents duplicates
  - Displayed in payment history, email confirmations, and success messages
- ✅ **Idempotency & Concurrency Safety**:
  - Payment verification is fully idempotent (duplicate requests return existing receipt)
  - Database transaction ensures atomic slot allocation
  - Conditional update with `WHERE paymentStatus='pending'` prevents race conditions
  - Concurrent requests: Winner processes payment, losers return cached receipt (200 OK)
  - No slot over-allocation even under high concurrency
- ✅ **Payment Success Flow**:
  1. Frontend initiates payment via Stripe Elements
  2. Backend creates PaymentIntent with server-calculated amount
  3. User completes payment in Stripe checkout
  4. Frontend calls `/api/verify-payment` with PaymentIntent ID
  5. Backend verifies payment status with Stripe API
  6. Atomic transaction: Update payment status → Allocate slots
  7. Generate receipt number and send confirmation email
  8. Update email status in database
  9. Return success response with receipt details
  10. Frontend displays success message with receipt number
  11. Payment appears in company admin's payment history
- ✅ **Security Features**:
